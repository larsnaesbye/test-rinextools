# `rinex-cli` for `teqc`'ers

(document WIP: Its structure is in part based on the 2014 UNAVCO document "[Teqc tutorial: Basics of Teqc
Use and Teqc Products](https://www.unavco.org/software/data-processing/teqc/doc/UNAVCO_Teqc_Tutorial.pdf)" by Lou Estey and Stuart Wier.)

This aims to be a simple tutorial for those who wish to transition away from the unsupported and closed source
UNAVCO `teqc` tool towards the newer open source `rinex-cli`.

Although a full 1-1 replacement cannot be achieved, this guide should help you replace your existing scripts and take
advantage of the new functionality.
